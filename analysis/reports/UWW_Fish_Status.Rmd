# Background

This qualitative biological assessment focuses on the historic and contemporary distribution and status of spring-run Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*; hereafter Chinook salmon), Middle Columbia River summer steelhead (*O. mykiss*; hereafter steelhead; ESA-listed threatened), Columbia River bull trout (*Salvelinus confluentus*; ESA-listed threatened), and Pacific lamprey (*Lampetra tridentata*) in the Upper Walla Walla watershed. Following is a description of previously identified limiting factors within the Upper Walla Walla watershed, which in many cases, are interrelated and shared among focal species.


# Spring-run Chinook Salmon

## Distribution

There are historical accounts of spring-run Chinook salmon occurring in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed in Mill Creek, the Walla Walla River, the North Fork Walla Walla River, the South Fork Walla Walla River, and many Upper Walla Walla River watershed tributaries [@Swindell1942; @Volkman2005]. The contemporary Upper Walla Walla River watershed Chinook salmon distribution spans the mainstem Walla Walla River, the South Fork Walla Walla River, and Mill Creek [@Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. <!-- I can't find recent reports of Chinook salmon occurring in the North Fork Walla Walla River since 1942. Anyone know differently? -->

Chinook salmon are documented to have historically spawned in approximately the upper 40 km of the mainstem Walla Walla River [@Fulton1968]. Documentation of spawning runs, habitat attributes, and the contemporary spawning distribution indicate Mill Creek, the North Fork Walla Walla River, South Fork Walla Walla River, and various Walla Walla River tributaries were also likely important Chinook salmon spawning grounds historically [@Swindell1942; @Fulton1968; @Volkman2005; @Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Yun2016]. The contemporary spawning distribution includes Mill Creek above Mill Creek Diversion Dam (also referred to as Bennington Dam), the mainstem Walla Walla River above Nursery Bridge Dam, and the South Fork Walla Walla River [@Mendel2007; @Mendel2014]. There is no evidence that Chinook salmon currently spawn in the North Fork Walla Walla River [@Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. Figure \@ref(fig:UWW-CHN-DIST) shows the current estimated distribution of spring-run Chinook salmon in the Upper Walla Walla watershed according to StreamNet (https://www.streamnet.org).

```{r UWW-CHN-DIST, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Current distribution of spring-run Chinook salmon in the Upper Walla Walla watershed."}
knitr::include_graphics("../maps/UWW_Spring_CHN_Dist.png")

```

## Population status

The contemporary Upper Walla Walla River watershed Chinook salmon population size is smaller than historical estimates and natural-origin adult abundance is lower than the conservation goal of 1,100 adults [@Mahoney2009]. The abundance of natural-origin Chinook salmon shows a slightly increasing trend, but the abundance of hatchery-origin upstream migrating adults shows a decreasing trend [@Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Yun2016].

There are accounts of large Chinook salmon runs in the Walla Walla River watershed [@Swindell1942; @Volkman2005]. The last sizeable run in the Walla Walla River watershed took place in 1925 and by the late 1950s Chinook salmon were extirpated [@Nielson1950; @VanCleve1960; @ACOE1997; @Mendel2000; @Mahoney2009]. Movement of Chinook salmon into Mill Creek was blocked between 1942 and 1985 after the construction of the Mill Creek Diversion Dam (rkm 18.5) and Mill Creek Division Dam (rkm 16.9) until fish ladders were installed at both dams in 1985 [@Martin1992; @Mahoney2009]. Reintroductions of adults and smolts to the South Fork Walla Walla River and Mill Creek started in 2000 and 2005, respectively [@Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009].

Counts of upstream migrating adult Chinook salmon at Nursery Bridge Dam are used as the primary index of run sizes and population abundance in the Walla Walla River watershed. Additional counts have been made at Mill Creek Diversion Dam, Yellowhawk Creek Weir, and Mill Creek Division Dam [@Mahoney2009]. Smolt abundance was monitored in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed using two traps, one in the Upper Walla Walla River and one in Mill Creek [@Mendel2014]. Upstream migrating adult Chinook salmon were first documented at Nursery Bridge Dam in 2000 and in upper Mill Creek at the Mill Creek Diversion Dam in 2004 [@Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009]. In 2004, the first adults returned as progeny from initial reintroductions [@Mahoney2009]. From 2000 to 2004, a total of 84 upstream migrating adult Chinook salmon returned to the Upper Walla Walla River watershed and were likely strays from the Umatilla River [@Mahoney2009]. Counts of upstream migrating natural-origin Chinook salmon at Nursery Bridge Dam (2000 - 2013) ranged from 2 (2003) to 293 (2011), exhibited a positive trend, and a 10-year geometric mean of 142 [@Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. Counts of hatchery-origin Chinook salmon at Nursery Bridge Dam (2007 - 2013) ranged from 29 (2013) to 932 (2010), had a negative trend, and a 7-year geometric mean of 204 [@Mendel2014]. Total counts of upstream migrating adults (natural-origin plus hatchery-origin fish) declined from 2010 to 2013, primarily driven by a reduction in hatchery-origin counts [@Mendel2014]. The abundance of naturally produced smolts in the Walla Walla River basin has been stable (2005 - 2013) and the smolt-to-adult survival rate of natural-origin Chinook salmon exhibited a positive trend (2002 - 2010) [@Mendel2014]. Counts of upstream migrating adult Chinook salmon returning to Mill Creek (counted at Mill Creek Diversion Dam, Yellowhawk Creek Weir, and Mill Creek Division Dam from 2004 to 2008) ranged from a low of 0 (2007) to a high of 68 (2004) with a 5-year geometric mean of 21.8 (± 33.0) [@Mahoney2009].

Redd counts in sections of the upper mainstem of the Walla Walla River, South Fork Walla Walla River, and Mill Creek began in 2000 and sampling expanded in 2005 to include the entire spring-run Chinook salmon production area in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. During 2000 - 2008, the number of redds at sampling locations generally increased in the South Fork Walla Walla River and upper mainstem Walla Walla River and the number of redds in Mill Creek remained relatively constant [@Mahoney2009].


# Middle Columbia River Summer Steelhead

## Distribution

Historically, steelhead occupied much of the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@WDFW1993; @Mendel2001; @Mendel2014]. The steelhead spawning distribution has been dramatically reduced in the Lower Walla Walla River watershed, but much of the historical spawning grounds in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed are still used, although habitat degradation has likely eliminated spawning habitat in some areas [@Kuttel2001; @Mahoney2009; @NOAA2021]. Anadromous life history was not expressed by *O. mykiss* in Mill Creek between 1942 and 1990, the period when Mill Creek Division Dam and Mill Creek Diversion Dam prevented movement of fish further upstream [@Martin1992]. Fish ladders were installed at both dams in 1985 and steelhead were first documented returning to Mill Creek above the Mill Creek Diversion Dam in 1990 [@Martin1992; @Mahoney2009]. Spawning occurs in the mainstem Walla Walla River from Nursery Bridge Dam downstream to at least Mill Creek and possibly below, in many Walla Walla River tributaries (e.g., Couse Creek, Yellowhawk Creek, and Cottonwood Creek), the South Fork Walla Walla River, the North Fork Walla Walla River, and Mill Creek above Mill Creek Diversion Dam and at its confluence with the Walla Walla River [@Mahoney2009; @Carmichael2010; @Mendel2014; @Yun2016]. @Mendel2014 report that steelhead spawn in several Mill Creek tributaries, but do not specify which tributaries spawning occurs in or provide empirical evidence to support this claim. Likely, steelhead spawning historically occurred throughout most of Mill Creek, but does not currently occur throughout most of the section downstream of Mill Creek Diversion Dam, likely due to habitat degradation from the Mill Creek Flood Control Project, agriculture, livestock grazing, and urbanization [@Underwood1995; @Mahoney2009; @NOAA2021]. Figure \@ref(fig:UWW-STH-DIST) shows the current estimated distribution of summer-run steelhead in the Upper Walla Walla watershed according to StreamNet (https://www.streamnet.org).

```{r UWW-STH-DIST, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Current distribution of Middle Columbia River summer-run steelhead in the Upper Walla Walla watershed."}
knitr::include_graphics("../maps/UWW_Summer_STH_Dist.png")

```

## Population status

The contemporary steelhead population in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed is smaller than historical estimates, time-series data suggest abundance is decreasing, and both productivity (recruits per spawner) and adult abundance in the Walla Walla River watershed are below ESA minimum recovery goals [@WDFW1993; @Mendel2001; @NOAA2009; @Mendel2014; @NOAA2021; @Yun2016] [(ODFW salmon and steelhead recovery tracker)](http://www.odfwrecoverytracker.org/).

Counts of upstream migrating adults at Nursery Bridge Dam are used as the primary index of steelhead run sizes and population abundance in the Walla Walla River watershed. Fish counts at Nursery Bridge Dam do not include returns to important spawning areas in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed such as Mill Creek, Yellowhawk Creek, and Cottonwood Creek or returns to the Lower Walla Walla River watershed. During the period of 1993 - 2013, the Walla Walla River watershed steelhead population was inferred to be stable based on counts of upstream migrating adults at Nursery Bridge Dam [@Mahoney2009; @Carmichael2010; @Mendel2014]. During 2011-2019, upstream migrating adult counts at Nursery Bridge Dam exhibited a negative trend and the 10-year geometric mean of upstream migrating adults decreased, indicative of declining steelhead abundance in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Mendel2014; @NOAA2021] [(ODFW salmon and steelhead recovery tracker)](http://www.odfwrecoverytracker.org/). Five-year mean counts of hatchery-origin upstream migrating adults were less than 4% from 1993 - 2014, but the most recent 5-year mean count of hatchery origin upstream migrating adults (2015 - 2019) was 13% [@Carmichael2010; @Mendel2014] [(ODFW salmon and steelhead recovery tracker)](http://www.odfwrecoverytracker.org/). @Mahoney2009 conducted partial counts of returning steelhead (not all fish could be counted due to logistical constraints) on upper Yellowhawk Creek (at Yellowhawk weir) and Mill Creek (at Mill Creek Division Dam and Mill Creek Diversion Dam) during 1990 - 2005. Counts ranged from 1 fish in 1998 to 57 fish in 2001 [@Mahoney2009]. The 16-year mean return was 21.6 adults, with a 13.9% mean return of hatchery-origin upstream migrating adults. Downstream migrating smolts trapped in the Upper Walla Walla River showed a positive trend during 2009 - 2013 and adult-to-adult returns (based on counts at Nursery Bridge Dam) were stable during 1993 - 2006 [@Mendel2014].

The ESA minimum recovery abundance goal for the Walla Walla River watershed is 1,000 adults and the minimum productivity goal is 1.35 [@WDFW1993]. The adult population size has been consistently estimated to be below the ESA recovery goal and the most recent 10-year (2010 - 2019) geometric mean of natural-origin steelhead spawners available is 713 [@Mahoney2009; @NOAA2009; @Mendel2014; @Yun2016 @NOAA2021] [(ODFW salmon and steelhead recovery tracker)](http://www.odfwrecoverytracker.org/). Productivity has fluctuated above and below the ESA recovery goal and the most recent 20-year (1993 - 2012) geometric mean productivity estimate available for the Walla Walla River watershed steelhead population is 0.9873, below the minimum productivity goal [@Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @NOAA2021] [(ODFW salmon and steelhead recovery tracker)](http://www.odfwrecoverytracker.org/).


# Columbia River Bull Trout

## Distribution

Historically, bull trout likely occurred throughout most of the Upper Walla Walla River watershed, but are now largely absent from much of the mainstem Walla Walla River and highly anthropogenically modified reaches within the Upper Walla Walla River watershed, such as Mill Creek below the Mill Creek Diversion Dam and the mainstem Walla Walla River downstream of rkm 75 <!-- Need to double-check this because some of the rkm estimates used in earlier papers have not been particularly accurate - is there a landmark?-->[@Buchanan1997; @Mendel2007; @Barrows2014; @Howell2016]. Fluvial and resident bull trout persist in the upper portion of the mainstem Walla Walla River, in the North Fork and South Fork Walla Walla River, and Mill Creek [@Martin1992; @Underwood1995; @Buchanan1997; @Al-Chokhachy2005; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2007; @Anglin2009; @Howell2016; @Yun2016].

Fluvial bull trout exhibit substantial movement and seasonal differences in distribution and habitat use in the Walla Walla River watershed. Fluvial bull trout over-winter in the upper mainstem Walla Walla River and the lower reaches of the North Fork and South Fork Walla Walla River and Walla Walla River tributaries such as Mill Creek from December through June, summer rearing and the upstream spawning migration occurs from June through September, and the fall return to rearing areas occurs in October and November [@Anglin2009; @Howell2016]. During periods of low flow, bull trout are mostly limited to the upper portions of the Upper Walla Walla River watershed subbasins due to high water temperatures in the lower reaches [@Al-Chokhachy2007; @Mendel2007]. Bull trout move between the Walla Walla River basin and the Columbia River system and different subbasins with the Walla Walla River watershed, such as the South Fork Walla Walla River and Mill Creek [@Anglin2009; @Newlon2018; @Howell2016].

The historical bull trout spawning distribution in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed is not documented prior to 1990 [@Martin1992; @Buchanan1997]. However, habitat degradation and declines in the spawning distributions of steelhead and Chinook salmon in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed suggests the bull trout spawning distribution has likely shrunk [@Buchanan1997; @Jacobs2009; @Mahoney2009; @Schaller2014]. Contemporary bull trout spawning occurs in Mill Creek and the South Fork Walla Walla River [@Barrows2014; @Budy2017; @Yun2016]. Redd counts have been consistently higher in the South Fork Walla Walla River than in Mill Creek from 1990 to 2007 [@Barrows2014; @Conner2014]. In Mill Creek, much of the spawning is concentrated between Deadman Creek and North Fork Mill Creek, with spawning also occurring in several Mill Creek tributaries, including Bull Creek, Deadman Creek, Paradise Creek, Broken Creek, and Low Creek [@Martin1992; @Underwood1995; @Buchanan1997; @Mendel2007; @Jacobs2009; @Howell2016]. Spawning in the South Fork Walla Walla River watershed primarily occurs between Table Creek and Reser Creek and in the lower portions of Reser Creek and Skiphorton Creek [@Buchanan1997; @Al-Chokhachy2005; @Budy2017]. Spawning may occur in the North Fork Walla Walla River, but requires verification [@Barrows2014]. Figure \@ref(fig:UWW-BLT-DIST) shows the current estimated distribution of bull trout in the Upper Walla Walla watershed according to StreamNet (https://www.streamnet.org).

```{r UWW-BLT-DIST, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Current distribution of bull trout in the Upper Walla Walla watershed."}
knitr::include_graphics("../maps/UWW_Bull_Trout_Dist.png")

```

## Population status

Historical bull trout abundance in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed is poorly documented, but habitat degradation and putative decreases in the bull trout distribution in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed suggest a corresponding reduction in population size. Contemporary mark-recapture and redd count data indicate that the bull trout population in the Walla Walla River watershed is stable.

Bull trout redd counts in Mill Creek increased during 1990 - 1994, declined slightly during 1994 - 2007, and were most abundant in 2000 and 2001 [@Martin1992; @Underwood1995; @Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009]. In the South Fork Walla Walla River redd counts increased from 1994 until 2001, declined again until 2007, increased from 2007 - 2009, then declined until 2011 [@Al-Chokhachy2005; @Mahoney2009; @Barrows2014; @Budy2017]. Upstream migrating adult counts at Nursery Bridge Dam showed a slightly positive trend from 2000 to 2008 and a strongly positive trend from 2008 to 2013, with counts ranging between a low of 20 in 2000 and a high of 416 in 2011 [@Mendel2014]. Upstream migrating adult counts during 2004 - 2008 for upper Mill Creek (counts from Yellowhawk Weir, Mill Creek Division Dam, and Mill Creek Diversion Dam) ranged between a low of three and a high of 20 adults (not sufficient data for trend analysis) [@Mahoney2009]. A mark-recapture study on Mill Creek bull trout during 1998 - 2009 found that adult abundance was stable during 1998 - 2005, then declined 63% during 2006 - 2010, driven primarily by a reduction in adult returns [@Howell2016]. A mark-recapture study in the South Fork Walla Walla River during 2002 - 2011 inferred a population growth rate of 1.01 (95% confidence interval = 0.84-1.20), indicating a stable population [@Barrows2014; @Budy2017]. However, the adult population was dominated by small adults, and the contribution of large adults to total biomass declined during the study period [@Budy2017].


# Pacific Lamprey

## Distribution

Pacific lamprey once occurred throughout much of the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Swindell1942; @Jackson1997]. Pacific lamprey now appear to be extirpated from their entire historical range within the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Jackson1997; @Close2000; @Kostow2002; @Moser2003; @Harris2017].

## Population status

There are no quantitative data available on the historical abundance of Pacific lamprey in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed. However, interviews with tribal members and fisheries biologists and the historical importance of several locations within the Walla Walla River watershed for Pacific lamprey harvest by the CTUIR, including the North and South forks of the Walla Walla River and nearby Skiphorton Creek on the mainstem Walla Walla River, indicate Pacific lamprey were once abundant in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Swindell1942; @Jackson1997]. Pacific lamprey have not been identified in any surveys conducted within the past 25 years, suggesting they are now extirpated from the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Close2000; @Close2001; @Kostow2002; @Moser2003; @Harris2017]. Pacific lamprey were most recently documented in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed in 1997 near the confluence of the Walla Walla River and the Little Walla Walla River [@Jackson1997]. @Jackson1997 recovered fifty-five lamprey from sediment removed from the Little Walla Walla River diversion structure, of which four were Pacific lamprey and 51 were western brook lamprey (*Lempetra richardsoni*).


# Limiting Factors

A number of interrelated factors limiting population productivity have previously been identified in the Upper Walla Walla watershed. Limiting factors were not separated for each species, as most are shared among species.

## Riparian Habitat

River channelization, straightening, channel incision, construction of impoundments, flood control structures, and irrigation diversions, timber harvest, urbanization, and agriculture has eliminated riparian habitat in many parts of the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Martin1992; @Buchanan1997; @Kuttel2001; @Beechie2008; @Carmichael2010; @Barrows2014]. Riparian habitat is in especially poor condition along portions of Garrison Creek, the Walla Walla River, lower reaches of Mill Creek, the North Fork Walla Walla River, and Yellowhawk Creek [@Buchanen1997; @Kuttel2001; @Beechie2008; @Mendel2007]. High quality riparian habitat is more prevalent along the South Fork Walla Walla River and tributaries (e.g., Reser Creek and Skiphorton Creek) and upper Mill Creek and tributaries (e.g., North Fork Mill Creek, Paradise Creek, Broken Creek, Low Creek, and Tiger Creek) [@Buchanen1997; @Kuttel2001].

Riparian zones influence a number of more proximal limiting factors for focal species in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed, including water temperature, woody debris, sedimentation, chemical pollution, North American beavers (*Castor canadensis*), and food webs, and are considered crucial for maintaining aquatic ecosystem integrity [@Allen2003; @Kiffney2003; @Martin1999; @Naiman1988; @Richardson2010; @Rutherford2004; @Sweeney2004]. High quality riparian habitat is considered a key limiting factor for all life stages of all focal species [@Barrows2014; @Carmichael2010]. There have been efforts to restore riparian habitat in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed, but additional work is needed [@Carmichael2010; @Mahoney2009].

## Temperature

Rising air temperatures, removal of riparian vegetation, sedimentation, and water extractions resulting in low flows have increased stream temperatures in the Upper Walla Walla watershed [@Kuttel2001; @Mendel2001; @Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. High water temperatures can be acutely lethal to fishes, impose a variety of sublethal fitness costs, and create barriers to movement [@Meeuwig2005; @Bjornn1991; @McCullough1999; @Richter2005; @Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Whitesel2022]. Water temperatures high enough to harm focal species have been recorded in many locations in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed, including in Blue Creek, Bryant Creek, Caldwell Creek, Cold Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Doan Creek, East Little Walla Walla River, Garrison Creek, Mill Creek, Russell Creek, Stone Creek, the Walla Walla River, West Little Walla Walla River, and Yellowhawk Creek [@Kuttel2001; @Mendel2001; @Johnson2004; @Mendel2007; @Baldwin2008; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014].

High water temperatures in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed have previously been identified as the most important limiting factor for Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout [@Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Schaller2014]. Warm temperatures have also been identified as a potential limiting factor for Pacific lamprey in the Upper Walla Walla watershed, but relationships between water temperature and Pacific lamprey physiology, ecology, and distributions are poorly understood [@Close1995; @Jackson1997; @Close2000; @Mallatt1983; @Meeuwig2005; @Whitesel2022]. Bull trout is the focal species most sensitive to warm temperatures, with maximum temperature thresholds to avoid detrimental effects to juvenile rearing, adult migration, and spawning of 12-14^o^C, 10-14^o^C, and 7-9^o^C, respectively [@Selong2005; @Mendel2007]. Chinook salmon and steelhead are more tolerant of warm temperatures, with maximum temperature thresholds to avoid detrimental effects to juvenile rearing, adult migration, and spawning of 15-18^o^C, 17-20^o^C, and 12.5-14^o^C, respectively [@Bjornn1991; @McCullough1999; @Richter2005; @Mendel2007]. The temperature tolerance of Pacific lamprey, particularly adults, is poorly understood. However, @Meeuwig2005 documented elevated mortality of ammocetes at temperatures of 22^o^C relative to cooler temperatures and @Whitesel2022 documented elevated ammocete mortality at temperatures of 30^o^C relative to cooler temperatures. @Moser2019 report that in aquaculture settings, Pacific lamprey adults are generally held at temperatures between 3-15.5^o^C, but that adult lamprey can be help at temperatures up to 27^o^C for long periods without increased mortality.

Suboptimal temperatures for focal species primarily occur in the Upper Walla Walla watershed from May through October. Consequently, high water temperatures have the potential to negatively impact the juvenile and adult life stages of all focal salmonid species, including adult steelhead during upstream migrations in September - October and May - June, adult bull trout during downstream migrations in September - October and May - July, and Chinook salmon during upstream migrations in May - July [@Kuttel2001; @Mende2001; @Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. There is empirical evidence that in some years Chinook salmon run timing has been truncated in late May and upstream steelhead migrations may be inhibited during the summer by warm water temperatures in the Walla Walla River watershed [@Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Yun2016]. There is also evidence that warm temperatures exclude Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout from portions of the Walla Walla River and the lower reach of several Upper Walla Walla tributaries during the summer [@Al-Chokhachy2007; @Mendel2007; @Yun2016].

## Sedimentation

Contemporary sedimentation rates are above historical levels in many areas in the Upper Walla Walla watershed due to increased erosion from agricultural activities, urbanization, and removal of riparian habitat [@Beechie2008; @Underwood1995; @Kuttel2001]. High sedimentation rates have embedded cobble and gravel substrates in several areas in the Upper Walla Walla watershed, particularly in Garrison Creek, Yellowhawk Creek, the Walla Walla River, Mill Creek, and Skiphorton Creek [@Kuttel2001; @Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Barrows2014]. Deposition of fine sediments can kill salmonid embryos and all focal species require unembedded cobble and gravel substrate for redd construction and spawning and fine sediments can reduce embryonic survival [@Barrows2014; @Bowerman2014; @Clemens2010; @Gallion2014; @Gunckel2009; @Mayfield2014; @McMillan2015; @Moir2010]. Sedimentation is an important factor limiting the spawning distributions of focal salmonid species [@Barrows2014; @Bowerman2013; @Mahoney2009; @Gallion2014]. Due to the similar substrate requirements of focal salmonid species and Pacific lamprey, sedimentation also likely limits the quantity of suitable spawning habitat for Pacific lamprey in the Upper Walla Walla watershed [@Clemens2010].

## River Morphology

Substantial channelization, straitening, and channel incision and the construction of impoundments, flood control structures, and irrigation diversions has occurred throughout the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Beechie2008; @Barrows2014; @Buchanan1997; @Carmichael2010; @Kuttel2001]. This has reduced channel complexity, shortened several river reaches, diminished connectivity of main channels to floodplains, which in turn has eliminated in-channel, off-channel, and riparian fish habitat and negatively impacted the quality of remaining habitat in many ways, several of which we discuss further in separate subsections (e.g., sedimentation, temperature, food web structure, pool and riffle habitat, large woody debris, and riparian habitat) [@Barrows2014; @Buchanan1997; @Carmichael2010; @Kuttel2001]. Substantial alterations to river morphology, including elimination of off-channel habitat, reduced floodplain connectivity, has occurred in reaches of the Garrison Creek, the North Fork Walla Walla River, Walla Walla River, lower Mill Creek, and Yellowhawk Creek [@Buchanan1997; @Kuttel2001]. High quality off-channel habitat and floodplain connectivity remains in the upper reaches of Mill Creek and in Mill Creek tributaries (e.g., North Fork Mill Creek, Paradise Creek, Broken Creek, Low Creek, Tiger Creek) and the South Fork Walla Walla River and many of its tributaries (e.g., Reser Creek, and Skiphorton Creek). Altered river morphology has been identified as an important limiting factor for all life history stages of every focal species, impacting species via a myriad of proximal factors, most notably water quality and rearing and spawning habitat availability [@Buchanan1997; @Kuttel2001; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Mendel2007; @Schaller2014].

## Timing and Magnitude of Flows

Water withdrawals, regulation of water flows, and modification of river morphology has had major impacts on water flow in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed. Altered water flows have been identified as a limiting factor for all focal species [@Close1995; @Kuttel2001; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Mendel2007; @Schaller2014]. Altered water flows have impacted many biotic and abiotic processes in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed. For example, low water flows have caused barriers to fish movement, contributed to high water temperatures, reduced the quantity of available fish habitat, and diminished floodplain connectivity [@Anglin2009; @Kuttel2001; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2007]. Loss of high flows have prevented sediment from being flushed from gravel and cobble substrates that are used by focal species for spawning [@Kuttel2001]. Climate change is predicted to alter hydrographs throughout the Columbia River Basin in ways that may be harmful to all life stages of focal species [@Carmichael2010].

## Large Woody Debris

Removal of large woody debris from rivers, harvest of large trees from riparian areas that serve as inputs of large woody debris, and diminished connectivity of main channels to flood plains has reduced the volumes of large woody debris below historical levels in several areas in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Barrows2014; @Buchanan1997; @Carmichael2010; @Kuttel2001]. Large woody debris provides habitat for a several types of salmonid prey, stabilizes river beds and banks, captures gravel substrate important for salmonid and lamprey spawning, and contributes to the formation of pools, which are important habitat for all life stages of Pacific Lamprey and salmonids and have been positively correlated with bull trout densities in Mill Creek [@Bilby1981; @Gonzalez2017; @Hilderbrand1997; @Keller1979; @Martin1992; @Mossop2004; @Muhlfeld2005; @Roni2001]. Large woody debris volumes are particularly lacking in reaches of Garrison Creek, the North Fork Walla Walla River, the Walla Walla River, Yellowhawk Creek [@Buchanan1997; @Kuttel2001]. Multiple studies have identified the lack of large woody debris as a limiting factor for Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout in the Upper Walla Walla River [@Buchanan1997; @Carmichael2010; @Kuttel2001; @Volkman2005]. Large woody debris is not listed as a limiting factor by any Pacific Lamprey planning documents or research articles focused on upper Walla Walla River watershed. Additional research is needed to determine if large woody debris is a limiting factor for Pacific lamprey. Projects have added large woody debris to some areas in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Carmichael2010].

## Pool and Riffle Habitat

Changes to river morphology, sedimentation, removal of large woody debris, reduction in the size of the North American beaver population, and water withdrawals have eliminated pool and riffle habitat in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Beechie2008; @Carmichael2010; @Kuttel2001]. Pools and riffles are important habitat for all life stages of Pacific lamprey and focal salmonids [@Gonzalez2017; @Gunckel2009; @Martin1992; @Mossop2004; @Muhlfeld2005]. @Martin1992 found that in Mill Creek, 1+ year old juvenile bull trout, young of the year steelhead, and 1+ year old steelhead used pool habitat types more than run and riffle habitats, while young of the year bull trout used riffle habitats more than other habitats. Riffles are often used by Pacific lamprey for redd construction [@Gunckel2009]. Multiple studies have identified lack of pool and riffle habitats as limiting factors for Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Carmichael2010; @Kuttel2001; @Mendel2001; @Volkman2005]. Additional research is needed to determine if riffle and habitat availability is a limiting factor for Pacific lamprey in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed. 

## North American Beaver

The North American beaver population in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed is smaller than historically [@Kuttel2001]. North American beavers are keystone species that enhance river habitat complexity by creating low velocity off-channel habitat that is used by juvenile and adult salmonids and larval lampreys [@Bouwes2016; @Kemp2012; @Schultz2016]. The presence of beaver dams has been correlated with increased survival of juvenile salmonids, potentially because this habitat is hypothesized to help juvenile salmonids to escape predation, take refuge during high water flow events, and enhance productivity of prey species [@Bouwes2016; @Kemp2012]. Encouraging natural growth of the North American beaver population in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed has been identified as important to the recovery of salmonid populations [@Kuttel2001], but further research is needed to determine if it will also contribute to the recovery of Pacific lamprey.

## Chemical Water Pollution

Chlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and low levels of lead and mercury, all chemicals that are toxic to fishes [@Morcillo2017; @Murty2018], have been documented throughout the Upper Walla Walla watershed [@Hopkins1985; @Davis1994; @Davis1995; @Johnson2002; @Fischnaller2003; @Meredith2011]. Wastewater treatment plant effluent, urban water runoff, and erosion and runoff from agricultural fields have been identified as sources of this pollution [@Close1995; @Kuttel2001; @Johnson2002; @Schaller2014]. Chemical pollution is hypothesized to have contributed to declines in populations of focal species [@Jackson1997; @Mendel2007; @Schaller2014]. Chlorine pollution has been identified as the cause of fish kills in lower Mill Creek [@Mendel2007]. Ongoing mitigation efforts are successfully reducing chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyl pollution in the Walla Walla watershed and no additional fish kills related to acute toxicity from chemical pollutants have been reported [@Johnson2004; @Gray2006; @Lubliner2007; @Mendel2007; @Baldwin2008; @Carmichael2010]. Chemical water pollution is considered to be a secondary limiting factor for all focal species [@Close2000; @Kuttel2001; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Schaller2014; @NOAA2021].

## Dissolved Oxygen

Dissolved oxygen concentrations low enough to be harmful to fishes have been recorded at some sampling sites in the Walla Walla River, Mill Creek, and the Yellowhawk Creek tributaries Garrison Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Russel Creek [@Mendel2001; @Swanson2005; @Joy2007; @Baldwin2008; @Dugger2001]. Low levels of dissolved oxygen have been attributed to high primary productivity resulting from nutrient enrichment and warm water temperatures and reduced dissolved oxygen holding capacity due to warm water temperatures [@Swanson2005; @Joy2007]. Actions have been taken to improve dissolved oxygen levels in the Upper Walla Walla watershed, but have been met with limited success [@Carmichael2010; @Dugger2021]. Dissolved oxygen has not been identified as a key limiting factor for any focal species, but has been hypothesized to act as a secondary limiting factor for Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout and may be one of the multiple mechanisms through which temperature acts as a limiting factor in the watershed [@Mendel2001; @Carmichael2010]. Dissolved oxygen requirements are not well characterized for Pacific lamprey. Larval Pacific lamprey are thought to be relatively tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations, but adult Pacific lamprey appear to be only slightly less sensitive to low dissolved oxygen than focal salmonid species [@Swanson2005; @Lampman2021]. Additional research on the potential of dissolved oxygen to be a limiting factor is warranted.

## pH

High primary productivity resulting from nutrient enrichment through urban water runoff and erosion and runoff from agricultural fields has caused high pH in several locations in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Mendel2001; @Joy2007; @Dugger2021]. The Washington State Water Quality Standards consider a pH range of 6.5 - 8.5 to be safe for aquatic animals [@Joy2007]. High and low pH can have negative, sublethal effects and cause mortality in all life stages of salmonids and warm temperatures can amplify the harmful effects of high and low pH [@Daye2008; @Wagner1997]. Low pH can be lethal to lamprey embryos and larvae, but the effects of high pH are not well characterized for any life stage of Pacific lamprey [@Myllynen1997]. pH below 6.5 has not been recorded in the Upper Walla Walla watershed, but pH greater than 8.5 has been documented in several locations, including in Cottonwood Creek, Mill Creek, and the Walla Walla River [@Mendel2001; @Joy2007; @Dugger2021]. @Mendel2001 identified pH as a potential limiting factor of secondary importance for salmonids in the Upper Walla Walla watershed.

## Barriers To Movement

Anthropogenic physical (e.g., culverts, flood control and water diversion structures, and dewatered streambeds) and water quality (e.g., temperature and dissolved oxygen) barriers to fish movement have been identified throughout the Upper Walla Walla River watershed and are considered important limiting factors for all focal species [@Carmichael2010; @Kuttel2001; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2007]. Barriers to movement have been identified in Garrison Creek, the lower reaches of Mill Creek, Russel Creek, the Walla Walla River, and Yellowhawk Creek [@Kuttel2001; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2007]. Cottonwood Creek, the upper reaches of Mill Creek and tributary streams (e.g., North Fork Mill Creek, Paradise Creek, Broken Creek, Low Creek, and Tiger Creek), the North Fork Walla Walla River, and the South Fork Walla Walla River have relatively few anthropogenic barriers to fish movement [@Kuttel2001; @Mendel2007]. Some physical barriers have been removed, but additional work is needed to eliminate additional barriers, paying particular attention to facilitating the upstream migration of Pacific lamprey because their movement can be inhibited by conditions distinct from those that limit salmonids [@Goodman2017]. See @Kuttel2001 and @Mendel2007 for detailed lists and descriptions of physical barriers to fish movement in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed.

High water temperatures have been identified as the most important barrier to the movement of focal salmonid species related to water quality, potentially impacting juveniles and adults, including during migration [@Anglin2009; @Barrows2014; @Kuttel2001; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Mendel2007; @Mendel2001; @Yun2016]. High water temperatures likely impact the movement of all salmonid life stages, but appear particularly for adult migrations, including during adult steelhead upstream migrations in September - October and May - June, adult bull trout downstream migrations in September - October and May - July, and upstream Chinook salmon migrations during May - July [@Anglin2009; @Barrows2014; @Kuttel2001; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Mendel2007; @Mendel2001; @Yun2016]. Additional research is needed to determine if high temperatures or other water quality variables are barriers to the movement of Pacific lamprey.

## Food Webs

The substantial anthropogenic modification of the Upper Walla Walla River watershed has likely impacted food webs in a variety of ways. For example, degradation of riparian habitat can reduce inputs of terrestrial insects into rivers and nutrient enrichment can lead to increased primary productivity and abundances of aquatic macroinvertebrates [@DeBruyn2003; @Kiffney2003; @Xiang2016]. Additionally, changes to the Upper Walla Walla River ecosystem have likely impacted native fishes other than focal species, which may alter prey availability. 

Changes in prey availability are a primary mechanism through which anthropogenic modification of food webs might impact focal species and has been proposed as a potential explanation for the substantial spatial variation in bull trout growth rates in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Bowerman2014]. Larval lamprey primarily feed on suspended detritus, algae, and diatoms and may benefit from nutrient enrichment and increased primary productivity [@Moore1980]. The availability of invertebrate prey potentially impacts all focal salmonid species because at small sizes, Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout primarily consume aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates before transitioning to piscivory at larger sizes [@Budy2007; @Huntsman2019; @Johnson1980; @Litz2017; @Lowery2015; @Martin1992; @Monnet2020; @Schoby2011; @Hunstman2019].

Chinook salmon and steelhead typically become piscivorous after migrating to marine environments [@Atcheson2012; @Huntsman2019; @Litz2017]. Putatively, adult Chinook salmon don’t consume significant quantities of fish in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed because this species typically doesn’t feed during upstream spawning migrations or in freshwater after spawning [@Quinn2018]. In contrast, *O. mykiss* are likely highly piscivorous in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed because non-migratory individuals grow to sizes at which this species can consume other fishes and steelhead can resume feeding in freshwater after spawning [@Savvaitova2003; @Kendall2015]. Pacific lamprey parasitically feed on fishes, but don’t often feed in freshwater environments [@Beamish1980; @Close1995]. Consequently, steelhead and bull trout are likely the focal species that consume the greatest quantities of fish in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed, and thus are the most likely to be impacted by abundances of fish species that are important prey. Additional fishes native to the Upper Walla Walla River watershed that may be important prey for steelhead and bull trout include chiselmouth (*Acrocheilus alutaceus*), mountain whitefish (*Prosopium williamsoni*), margined sculpin (*Cottus marginatus*), Paiute sculpins (*Cottus beldingi*), torrent sculpins (*Cottus rhotheus*), western brook lampreys (*Lampetra richardsoni*), speckled dace (*Rhinichthys osculus*), longenose dace (*Rhinichthys alutaceus*), redside shiners (*Richardsonius balteatus*), bridgelip suckers (*Catostomus columbianus*), and largescale suckers (*Catostomus macrocheilus*) [@Budy2007; @Carlin2012 @Close2000; @Hopkins1991; @Johnson1997; @Johnson2002; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2007; @Mongillo1998; @Moser2003].

Only a handful of studies have investigated trophic interactions in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed. @Martin1992 and @Underwood1995 characterized the diets of juvenile *O. mykiss* and bull trout in Mill Creek. They report that the most important prey for juvenile bull trout and *O. mykiss* were aquatic macroinvertebrates. @Budy2006 investigated the diets of bull trout in the South Fork Walla Walla River and found that aquatic macroinvertebrates and fish were the most important prey items. Only one study has investigated prey availability for focal species in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed and found evidence that macroinvertebrate prey availability was not limiting for juvenile *O. mykiss* and bull trout in Mill Creek [@Underwood1995]. Additional research on the diets and abundances of focal species, other fishes, primary productivity, and non-fish prey (e.g., aquatic macroinvertebrates) is necessary to determine the extent to which prey availability or other mechanism associated with food webs are limiting to focal species in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed.

## Nonnative Species

Nonnative species have the potential to negatively impact focal species in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed, particularly through competition, predation, and hybridization. Brown trout (*Salmo trutta*), common carp (*Cyprinus carpio*), channel catfish (*Ictalurus punctatus*), smallmouth bass (*Micropterus dolomieu*), bluegill (*Lepomis macrochirus*), three-spine stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*) are non-native species that have been documented in the Walla Walla River watershed [@Fischnaller2003; @Johnson2004; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2007]. To date, these species are restricted to the lower Walla Walla River watershed and therefore nonnative species are not currently considered a limiting factor. However, the distributions of these species should be monitored as it is possible that they could expand their distributions into the Upper Walla Walla River watershed, particularly if water temperatures continue to increase.

## Unscreened Surface Water Diversions

Many unscreened irrigation diversions have been identified in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed and some screened diversions do not meet state criteria for fish screens [@Buchanan1997; @Carmichael2010; @Kuttel2001; @Mendel2001]. Fish passing through unscreened diversions can become stranded in agricultural fields [@Anglin2009; @Carmichael2010]. Unscreened irrigation diversions have likely caused substantial fish mortality in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed, and unscreened irrigation diversions are still considered a limiting factor for all focal species [@Anglin2009; @Carmichael2010]. Work has been done to add and improve screening on irrigation diversions, but additional screening may be needed and monitoring is required to ensure screens remain functional [@Buchanan1997; @Carmichael2010; @Kuttel2001; @Mahoney2009].
