# Background

This qualitative biological assessment focuses on the historic and contemporary distribution and status of spring-run Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*; hereafter Chinook salmon), Middle Columbia River summer steelhead (*O. mykiss*; hereafter steelhead; ESA-listed threatened), Columbia River bull trout (*Salvelinus confluentus*; ESA-listed threatened), and Pacific lamprey (*Lampetra tridentata*) in the Upper Walla Walla watershed. Following is a description of previously identified limiting factors within the Upper Walla Walla watershed, which in many cases, are shared among focal species.


# Spring-run Chinook Salmon

## Distribution

There are historical accounts of spring-run Chinook salmon occurring in the Walla Walla River basin within Mill Creek, the mainstem Walla Walla River, North Fork Walla Walla River, South Fork Walla Walla River, and Upper Walla Walla River watershed tributaries [@Swindell1942; @Volkman2005]. The contemporary Upper Walla Walla River watershed Chinook salmon distribution spans the upper mainstem Walla Walla River, South Fork Walla Walla River, and Mill Creek [@Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. <!-- I can't find recent reports of Chinook salmon occurring in the North Fork Walla Walla River since 1942. Anyone know differently? -->

Chinook salmon are documented to have historically spawned in approximately the upper 40 km of the mainstem Walla Walla River [@Fulton1968]. Documentation of spawning runs, habitat attributes, and the contemporary spawning distribution indicate Mill Creek, the North Fork Walla Walla River, South Fork Walla Walla River, and various Walla Walla River tributaries were also likely historically important Chinook salmon spawning grounds [@Swindell1942; @Fulton1968; @Volkman2005; @Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. The contemporary spawning distribution includes Mill Creek above Mill Creek Diversion Dam (also referred to as Bennington Dam), the mainstem Walla Walla River above Nursery Bridge Dam, and the South Fork Walla Walla River [@Mendel2007; @Mendel2014]. There is no evidence that Chinook salmon currently spawn in the North Fork Walla Walla River [@Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. Figure \@ref(fig:UWW-CHN-DIST) shows the current estimated distribution of spring-run Chinook salmon in the Upper Walla Walla watershed according to StreamNet (https://www.streamnet.org).

knitr::include_graphics("../maps/UWW_Spring_CHN_Dist.png")

```

## Population status

The contemporary Upper Walla Walla River watershed Chinook salmon population size is smaller than historical estimates and natural-origin adult abundance is lower then the current conservation goal of 1,100 adults [@Mahoney2009]. The abundance of natural-origin Chinook salmon show a slightly increasing trend, but the abundance of hatchery-origin upstream migrating adults show a decreasing trend [@Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014].

Historical accounts report large runs of Chinook salmon in the Walla Walla River watershed [@Swindell1942; @Volkman2005]. The last sizeable run in the Walla Walla River watershed took place in 1925 and by the late 1950s Chinook salmon were extirpated [@Nielson1950; @VanCleve1960; @ACOE1997; @Mendel2000; @Mahoney2009]. Movement of Chinook salmon into Mill Creek was blocked between 1942 and 1985 after the construction of the Mill Creek Diversion Dam and Mill Creek Division Dam until fish ladders were installed at both dams in 1985 [@Martin1992; @Mahoney2009]. Reintroductions of adults and smolts to the South Fork Walla Walla River and Mill Creek started in 2000 and 2005, respectively [@Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009].

Counts of upstream migrating adult Chinook salmon at Nursery Bridge Dam are used as the primary index of run sizes and population abundance in the Walla Walla River watershed and additional counts are made at Mill Creek Diversion Dam, Yellowhawk Creek weir, and Mill Creek Division Dam [@Mahoney2009]. Smolt abundance was monitored in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed using two traps, one in the Upper Walla Walla River and one in Mill Creek [@Mendel2014]. Upstream migrating adult Chinook salmon were first documented at Nursery Bridge Dam in 2000 and in upper Mill Creek at the Mill Creek Diversion Dam in 2004 [@Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009]. In 2004, the first adults returned as progeny from initial reintroductions [@Mahoney2009]. From 2000 to 2004, a total of 84 upstream migrating adult Chinook salmon returned to the Upper Walla Walla River watershed and were likely strays from the Umatilla River [@Mahoney2009]. Counts of natural-origin Chinook salmon at Nursery Bridge Dam (2000 - 2013) ranged from 2 (2003) to 293 (2011), exhibited a positive trend, and a 10-year geometric mean of 142 [@Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. Counts of hatchery-origin Chinook salmon at Nursery Bridge Dam (2007 - 2013) ranged from 29 (2013) to 932 (2010), had a negative trend, and a 7-year geometric mean of 204 [@Mendel2014]. Total counts of upstream migrating adults (natural-origin plus hatchery-origin fish) declined from 2010 to 2013, primarily driven by a reduction in hatchery-origin counts [@Mendel2014]. The abundance of naturally produced smolts in the Walla Walla River basin has been stable (2005 - 2013) and the smolt-to-adult survival rate of natural-origin Chinook salmon exhibits a positive trend (2002 - 2010) [@Mendel2014]. Counts of upstream migrating adult Chinook salmon returning to Mill Creek (counted at Mill Creek Diversion Dam, Yellowhawk Creek weir, and Mill Creek Division Dam from 2004 to 2008) ranged from a low of 0 (2007) to a high of 68 (2004) with a 5-year geometric mean of 21.8 (Â± 33.0) [@Mahoney2009].

Redd counts in sections of the upper mainstem of the Walla Walla River, South Fork Walla Walla River, and Mill Creek began in 2000 and sampling expanded in 2005 to include the entire spring-run Chinook salmon production area in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. During 2000 - 2008, the number of redds at sampling locations generally increased in the South Fork Walla Walla River and upper mainstem Walla Walla River and the number of redds in Mill Creek remained relatively constant [@Mahoney2009].


# Middle Columbia River Summer Steelhead

## Distribution

Historically, steelhead occupied much of the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@WDFW1993; @Mendel2001; @Mendel2014]. The steelhead spawning distribution has been dramatically reduced in the Lower Walla Walla River watershed, but much of the historical spawning grounds in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed are still used [@Mahoney2009; @NOAA2021]. Anadromous life history was not expressed by *O. mykiss* in Mill Creek between 1942 and 1985 [@Martin1992]. The Mill Creek Division Dam (rkm 15.9), built in 1942, prevented movement of fish further upstream. Fish could bypass the Mill Creek Division Dam by traveling through Yellowhawk Creek, a Mill Creek distributary flowing from the Walla Walla River to Mill Creek. However, a second dam also constructed in 1942, the Mill Creek Diversion Dam (rkm 18.5) located approximately 1.6 km upstream of Mill Creek Division Dam, prevented fish from moving further upstream. Fish ladders were installed at both dams in 1985 and steelhead were first documented returning to Mill Creek above the Mill Creek Diversion Dam in 1990 [@Martin1992; @Mahoney2009]. Spawning occurs in the mainstem Walla Walla River from Nursery Bridge Dam downstream to at least Mill Creek and possibly below, in many Walla Walla River tributaries (e.g., Couse Creek, Yellowhawk Creek, and Cottonwood Creek), the South Fork Walla Walla River, the North Fork Walla Walla River, and Mill Creek above Mill Creek Diversion Dam and at its confluence with the Walla Walla River [@Mahoney2009; @Carmichael2010; @Mendel2014]. @Mendel2014 report that steelhead spawn in several Mill Creek tributaries, but do not specify which tributaries spawning occurs in or provide empirical evidence to support this claim. Likely, steelhead spawning historically occurred throughout most of Mill Creek, but does not currently occur throughout most of the section downstream of Mill Creek Diversion Dam, likely due to habitat degradation from the Mill Creek Flood Control Project, agriculture, and livestock grazing [@Underwood1995; @Mahoney2009; @NOAA2021]. Figure \@ref(fig:UWW-STH-DIST) shows the current estimated distribution of summer-run steelhead in the Upper Walla Walla watershed according to StreamNet (https://www.streamnet.org).

```{r UWW-STH-DIST, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Current distribution of Middle Columbia River summer-run steelhead in the Upper Walla Walla watershed."}
knitr::include_graphics("../maps/UWW_Summer_STH_Dist.png")

```

## Population status

The contemporary steelhead population in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed is smaller than historical estimates, time-series data suggest abundance is decreasing, and both productivity (recruits per spawner) and adult abundance in the Walla Walla River watershed are below ESA minimum recovery goals [@WDFW1993; @Mendel2001; @NOAA2009; @Mendel2014; @NOAA2021] [(ODFW salmon and steelhead recovery tracker)](http://www.odfwrecoverytracker.org/).

Counts of upstream migrating adults at Nursery Bridge Dam are used as the primary index of steelhead run sizes and population abundance in the Walla Walla River watershed. Fish counts at Nursery Bridge dam do not include returns to important spawning areas in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed such as Mill Creek, Yellowhawk Creek, and Cottonwood Creek or returns to the Lower Walla Walla River watershed. During the period of 1993 - 2013, the Walla Walla River watershed steelhead population was inferred to be stable based on counts of upstream migrating adults at Nursery Bridge Dam [@Mahoney2009; @Carmichael2010; @Mendel2014]. During 2011-2019, upstream migrating adult counts at Nursery Bridge Dam exhibited a negative trend and the 10-year geometric mean of upstream migrating adults decreased, indicative of declining steelhead abundance in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Mendel2014; @NOAA2021] [(ODFW salmon and steelhead recovery tracker)](http://www.odfwrecoverytracker.org/). Five-year mean counts of hatchery-origin upstream migrating adults were less than 4% from 1993 - 2014, but the most recent 5-year mean count of hatchery origin upstream migrating adults (2015 - 2019) was 13% [@Carmichael2010; @Mendel2014] [(ODFW salmon and steelhead recovery tracker)](http://www.odfwrecoverytracker.org/). @Mahoney2009 conducted partial counts of returning steelhead (not all fish could be counted due to logistical constraints) on upper Yellowhawk Creek (at Yellowhawk weir) and Mill Creek (at Mill Creek Division Dam and Mill Creek Diversion Dam) during 1990 - 2005. Counts ranged from 1 fish in 1998 to 57 fish in 2001 [@Mahoney2009]. The 16-year mean return was 21.6 adults, with a 13.9% mean return of hatchery-origin upstream migrating adults. Downstream migrating smolts trapped in the Upper Walla Walla River showed a positive trend during 2009 - 2013 and adult-to-adult returns (based on counts at Nursery Bridge Dam) were stable during 1993 - 2006 [@Mendel2014].

The ESA minimum recovery abundance goal for the Walla Walla River watershed is 1,000 adults and the minimum productivity goal is 1.35 [@WDFW1993]. The adult population size has been consistently estimated to be below the ESA recovery goal and the most recent 10-year (2010-2019) geometric mean of natural-origin steelhead spawners available is 713 [@Mahoney2009; @NOAA2009; @Mendel2014; @NOAA2021] [(ODFW salmon and steelhead recovery tracker)](http://www.odfwrecoverytracker.org/). Productivity has fluctuated above and below the ESA recovery goal and the most recent 20-year (1993 - 2012) geometric mean productivity estimate available for the Walla Walla River watershed steelhead population is 0.9873, below the minimum productivity goal [@Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @NOAA2021] [(ODFW salmon and steelhead recovery tracker)](http://www.odfwrecoverytracker.org/).


# Columbia River Bull Trout

## Distribution

Historically, bull trout are thought to have occurred throughout most of the Upper Walla Walla River watershed, but are now largely absent from much of the mainstem Walla Walla River and highly anthropogenically modified reaches within the Upper Walla Walla River watershed, such as Mill Creek below the Mill Creek Diversion Dam and the mainstem Walla Walla River downstream of rkm 75 <!-- Need to double-check this because some of the rkm estimates used in earlier papers have not been particularly accurate - is there a landmark?-->[@Buchanan1997; @Mendel2007; @Barrows2014; @Howell2016]. Fluvial and resident bull trout persist in the upper portion of the mainstem Walla Walla River, in the North Fork and South Fork Walla Walla River, and Mill Creek [@Martin1992; @Underwood1995; @Buchanan1997; @Al-Chokhachy2005; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2007; @Anglin2009; @Howell2016].

Fluvial bull trout exhibit substantial movement and seasonal differences in distribution and habitat use in the Walla Walla River watershed. Fluvial bull trout over-winter in the upper mainstem Walla Walla River and the lower reaches of the North Fork and South Fork Walla Walla River and Walla Walla River tributaries such as Mill Creek from December through June, summer rearing and the upstream spawning migration occurs from June through September, and the fall return to rearing areas occurs in October and November [@Anglin2009; @Howell2016]. During periods of low flow, bull trout are mostly limited to the upper portions of the Upper Walla Walla River watershed subbasins due to high water temperatures in the lower reaches [@Mendel2007]. Bull trout move between the Walla Walla River basin and the Columbia River system and different subbasins with the Walla Walla River watershed, such as the South Fork Walla Walla River and Mill Creek [@Anglin2009; @Newlon2018; @Howell2016].

The historical bull trout spawning distribution in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed is not documented prior to 1990 [@Martin1992; @Buchanan1997]. However, habitat degradation and declines in the spawning distributions of steelhead and Chinook salmon in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed suggests the bull trout spawning distribution has likely shrunk [@Buchanan1997; @Jacobs2009; @Mahoney2009; @Schaller2014]. Contemporary bull trout spawning occurs in Mill Creek and the South Fork Walla Walla River [@Barrows2014; @Budy2017]. Redd counts have been consistently higher in the South Fork Walla Walla River than in Mill Creek from 1990 to 2007 [@Barrows2014; @Conner2014]. In Mill Creek, much of the spawning is concentrated between Deadman Creek and North Fork Mill Creek, with spawning also occurring in several Mill Creek tributaries, including Bull Creek, Deadman Creek, Paradise Creek, Broken Creek, and Low Creek [@Martin1992; @Underwood1995; @Buchanan1997; @Mendel2007; @Jacobs2009; @Howell2016]. Spawning in the South Fork Walla Walla River watershed primarily occurs between Table Creek and Reser Creek and in the lower portions of Reser Creek and Skiphorton Creek [@Buchanan1997; @Al-Chokhachy2005; @Budy2017]. Spawning may occur in the North Fork Walla Walla River, but requires verification [@Barrows2014]. Figure \@ref(fig:UWW-BLT-DIST) shows the current estimated distribution of bull trout in the Upper Walla Walla watershed according to StreamNet (https://www.streamnet.org).

knitr::include_graphics("../maps/UWW_Bull_Trout_Dist.png")

```

## Population status

Historical bull trout abundance in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed is poorly documented, but habitat degradation and putative decreases in the bull trout distribution in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed suggest a corresponding reduction in population size. Contemporary mark-recapture and redd count data indicate that the bull trout population in the Walla Walla River watershed is stable.

Bull trout redd counts in Mill Creek increased during 1990 - 1994, declined slightly during 1994 - 2007, and were most abundant in 2000 and 2001 [@Martin1992; @Underwood1995; @Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009]. In the South Fork Walla Walla River redd counts increased from 1994 until 2001, declined again until 2007, increased from 2007-2009, then declined until 2011 [@Al-Chokhachy2005; @Mahoney2009; @Barrows2014; @Budy2017]. Upstream migrating adult counts at Nursery Bridge Dam showed a slightly positive trend from 2000 to 2008 and a stronly positive trend from 2008 to 2013, with counts ranging between a low of 20 in 2000 and a high of 416 in 2011 [@Mendel2014]. Upstream migrating adult counts during 2004 - 2008 for upper Mill Creek (counts from Yellowhawk weir, Mill Creek Division Dam, and Mill Creek Diversion Dam) ranged between a low of three and a high of 20 adults (not sufficient data for trend analysis) [@Mahoney2009]. A mark-recapture study on Mill Creek bull trout during 1998 - 2009 found that adult abundance was stable during 1998 - 2005, then declined 63% during 2006 - 2010, driven primarily by a reduction in adult returns [@Howell2016]. A mark-recapture study in the South Fork Walla Walla River during 2002 - 2011 inferred a population growth rate of 1.01 (95% confidence interval = 0.84-1.20), indicating a recently stable population [@Barrows2014; @Budy2017]. However, the adult population was dominated by small adults, and the contribution of large adults to total biomass declined during the study period [@Budy2017].


# Pacific Lamprey

## Distribution

Pacific lamprey once occurred throughout much of the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Swindell1942; @Jackson1997]. Pacific lamprey now appear to be extirpated from their entire historical range within the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Jackson1997; @Close2000; @Kostow2002; @Moser2003; @Harris2017].

## Population status

There are not quantitative trends of the historical abundance of Pacific lamprey in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed. However, interviews with tribal members and fisheries biologists and the historical importance of several locations within the Walla Walla River watershed for Pacific lamprey harvest by the CTUIR, including the North and South forks of the Walla Walla River and nearby Skiphorton Creek on the mainstem Walla Walla River, indicate Pacific lamprey were once abundant in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Swindell1942; @Jackson1997]. Pacific lamprey have not been confirmed in any surveys conducted within the past 25 years, suggesting they are now extirpated from the Upper Walla Walla River watershed [@Close2000; @Close2001; @Kostow2002; @Moser2003; @Harris2017]. Pacific lamprey were most recently documented in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed in 1997 near the confluence of the Walla Walla River and the Little Walla Walla River [@Jackson1997]. @Jackson1997 recovered fifty-five lamprey from sediment removed from the Little Walla Walla River diversion structure, of which four were Pacific lamprey and 51 were western brook lamprey (*Lempetra richardsoni*).


# Limiting Factors

A number of factors limiting population productivity have previously been identified in the Upper Walla Walla watershed. Limiting factors were not separated for each species, as most are shared among species.

## Temperature

Rising air temperatures, removal of riparian vegetation, sedimentation, and water extractions resulting in low flows, have increased stream temperatures in the Upper Walla Walla watershed [@Kuttel2001; @Mendel2001; @Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. High water temperatures can be acutely lethal to fishes, impose a variety of sublethal fitness costs, and create barriers to movement [@Meeuwig2005; @Bjornn1991; @McCullough1999; @Richter2005; @Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Whitesel2022]. Water temperatures high enough to harm focal species have been recorded in many locations in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed, including in Blue Creek, Bryant Creek, Caldwell Creek, Cold Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Doan Creek, East Little Walla Walla River, Garrison Creek, Mill Creek, Russell Creek, Stone Creek, the Walla Walla River, West Little Walla Walla River, and Yellowhawk Creek [@Kuttel2001; @Mendel2001; @Johnson2004; @Mendel2007; @Baldwin2008; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014].

High water temperatures in the Upper Walla Walla River watershed have previously been identified as the most important limiting factor for Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout [@Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Schaller2014]. Warm temperatures have also been identified as a potential limiting factor for Pacific lamprey in the Upper Walla Walla watershed, but relationships between water temperature and Pacific lamprey physiology, ecology, and distribtuions are poorly understood [@Close1995; @Jackson1997; @Close2000; @Mallatt1983; @Meeuwig2005; @Whitesel2022]. Bull trout is the focal species most sensitive to warm temperatures, with maximum temperature thresholds to avoid detrimental effects to juvenile rearing, adult migration, and spawning of 12-14^o^C, 10-14^o^C, and 7-9^o^C, respectively [@Selong2005; @Mendel2007]. Chinook salmon and steelhead are more tolerant of warm temperatures, with maximum temperature thresholds to avoid detrimental effects to juvenile rearing, adult migration, and spawning of 15-18^o^C, 17-20^o^C, and 12.5-14^o^C, respectively [@Bjornn1991; @McCullough1999; @Richter2005; @Mendel2007]. The temperature tolerance of Pacific lamprey, particularly adults, is poorly understoon. However, @Meeuwig2005 documented elevated mortality of ammocetes at temperatures of 22^o^C relative to cooler temperatures and @Whitesel2022 documented elevated ammocete mortality at temperatures of 30^o^C relative to cooler temperatures. @Moser2019 report that in aquaculture settings, Pacific lamprey adults are generally held at temperatures between 3-15.5^o^C, but that adult lamprey can be help at temepratures up to 27^o^C for long periods without increased mortality.

High temperatures primarily occur in the Upper Walla Walla watershed from May through September in areas where the juveniles of all focal salmonid species and adults during the upstream migration of steelhead, which enter the Walla Walla watershed from September through June of the next year, and downstream migration of bull trout after spawning during September, and upstream migrating Chinook salmon from May through July [@Kuttel2001; @Mende2001; @Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014]. There is evidence that in some years Chinook salmon run timing has been truncated in late May and upstream steelhead migrations may be inhibited during the summer by warm water temperatures in the Walla Walla River [@Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Yun2016]. There is also evidence that warm temperatures exclude Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout from portions of the Walla Walla River and the lower reach of several Upper Walla Walla tributaries during summer months [@Yun2016].

## Sedimentation

Contemporary sedimentation rates are above historical levels in many areas within the Upper Walla Walla watershed due to increased erosion resulting from agricultural activities and the removal or riparian habitat [@Underwood1995; @Kuttel2001]. High sedimentation rates have caused embedded cobble and gravel substrates in several areas in the Upper Walla Walla watershed, particularly in Garrison Creek, Yellowhawk Creek, the Walla Walla River, Mill Creek, and Skiphorton Creek [@Kuttel2001; @Mendel2007; @Mahoney2009; @Barrows2014]. All focal species require unembedded cobble and gravel substrate for redd construction and spawning and fine sediments can reduce embryonic survival [@Barrows2014; @Bowerman2014; @Clemens2010; @Gallion2014; @Mayfield2014; @McMillan2015; @Moir2010]. Sedimentation is an important factor limiting the spawning distributions of focal salmonid species [@Barrows2014; @Bowerman2013; @Mahoney2009; @Gallion2014]. Due to similar substrate requirements of focal salmonid species and Pacific lamprey, sedimentation will also likely limit spawning habitat for Pacific lamprey in the Upper Walla Walla watershed if a population is reestablished [@Clemens2010].

## Chemical Water Pollution

Chlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and low levels of lead and mercury, all chemicals that are toxic to fishes [@Morcillo2017; @Murty2018], have been documented throughout the Upper Walla Walla watershed [@Hopkins1985; @Davis1994; @Davis1995; @Johnson2002; @Fischnaller2003; @Meredith2011]. Wastewater treatment plant effluent, urban stormwater runoff, and erosion and runoff from agricultural fields have been implicated in pwater pollution in the watershed [@Close1995; @Kuttel2001; @Johnson2002; @Schaller2014]. Chemical pollution is hypothesized to have contributed to declines in populations of focal species [@Jackson1997; @Mendel2007; @Schaller2014] and chlorine pollution has been implicated for fish kills in lower Mill Creek [@Mendel2007]. Ongoing mitigation efforts are successfully reducing chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyl pollution in the Walla Walla watershed and no additional fish kills related to chemical pollution have been reported in more recent years [@Johnson2004; @Gray2006; @Lubliner2007; @Mendel2007; @Baldwin2008; @Carmichael2010]. Chemical water pollution is not considered to be a key limiting factor for any of the focal species [@Kuttel2001; @Mahoney2009; @Mendel2014; @Schaller2014; @NOAA2021].

## Dissolved Oxygen

Dissolved oxygen concentrations low enough to be harmful to fishes have been recorded at some sampling sites in the Walla Walla River, Mill Creek, and the Yellowhawk Creek tributaries Garrison Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Russel Creek [@Mendel2001; @Swanson; @Joy2007; @Baldwin2008; @Dugger2001]. Low levels of dissolved oxygen have been attributed to high primary productivity resulting from nutrient enrichment and warm water temperatures and reduced dissolved oxygen holding capacity due to warm water temperatures [@Swanson2005; @Joy2007]. Actions have been taken to improve dissolved oxygen levels in the Upper Walla Walla watershed, but have been met with limited success [@Carmichael2010; @Dugger2021]. Dissolved oxygen has not been identified as a key limiting factor for any of the focal species, but has been hypothesized to act as a secondary limiting factor for Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout and may be one of the multiple mechanisms through which temperature limits fishes in the watershed [@Mendel2001; @Carmichael2010]. Dissolved oxygen requirements are not well characterized for Pacific lamprey. Larval Pacific lamprey are thought to be relatively tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations, but adult Pacific lamprey appear to be only slightly less sensitive to low dissolved oxygen than focal salmonid species and additional research on the potential of dissolved oxygen to be a limiting factor is warranted [@Swanson2005; @Lampman2021].

## pH

High primary productivity resulting from nutrient enrichment through urban stormwater runoff and erosion and runoff from agricultural fields has caused high pH in several locations in the Upper Walla Walla watershed [@Mendel2001; @Joy2007; @Dugger2021]. The Washington State Water Quality Standards consider a pH range of 6.5 - 8.5 to be safe for aquatic life [@Joy2007]. High and low pH can have negative, sublethal effects and caus mortality in all life stages of salmonids and warm temperatures can amplify the harmful effects of high and low pH [@Daye2008; @Wagner1997]. Low pH can be lethal to lamprey embryos and larvae, but the effects of high pH are not well characterized for any life stage of Pacific lamprey [@Myllynen1997]. pH below 6.5 has not been recorded in the Upper Walla Walla watershed, but pH greater than 8.5 has been documented in several locations in Cottonwood Creek, Mill Creek, and the Walla Walla River [@Mendel2001; @Joy2007; @Dugger2021]. @Mendel2001 identified pH as a potential limiting factor of secondary importance for salmonids in the Upper Walla Walla watershed.
