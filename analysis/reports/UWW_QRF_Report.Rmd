# Background

Water is the cornerstone of First Food production and inherently tied to the five fundamental touchstones: hydrology, geomorphology, habitat and network connectivity, riverine biotic community, and riparian vegetation [@Jones2008]. The Umatilla River Vision defines a holistic approach to the restoration of water quality and the implications thereof. Population status and habitat use of riverine fishes defined as First Food (including Endangered Species Act [ESA] listed middle Columbia River summer-run steelhead, spring-run Chinook salmon, bull trout, and Pacific lamprey) are identified as critical data needs in the assessment of biotic communities [@Jones2008]. The decline of anadromous Pacific salmonids (*Oncorhynchus* spp.) across the Pacific Northwest, USA, has prompted numerous actions aimed at reversing that trend. These actions are often categorized into four ‘H’s’ - harvest modification, habitat rehabilitation, hydroelectric operations, and hatchery practices. Problematically, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the degree of change to salmon populations that can be exerted across and within these categories, and what combination of changes might most cost-effectively and sustainably reduce mortality and recover depleted populations. Recovery plans (e.g., @NOAA2009) have identified adult escapement targets at the population scale, providing a quantitative metric useful for evaluating the magnitude of survival improvements (across life-stages) required. These abundance targets provide a benchmark against which habitat rehabilitation actions can be measured. Here, we apply a novel approach to estimating life-stage specific habitat capacity for spring-run Chinook salmon (hereafter Chinook salmon) and summer-run steelhead (hereafter steelhead) that can be used to quantitatively estimate the magnitude of tributary habitat restoration needed to achieve recovery goals in the Upper Walla Walla watershed. The necessity of tributary habitat restoration actions can now be demonstrated, and the magnitude of required change can be placed in context with the other ‘H’s’.
 
We define habitat carrying capacity as the maximal abundance or load the stream habitat can support for a given species and life-stage given current physical habitat quantity and quality. Within fisheries research and management, it has long been recognized that biotic and abiotic factors limit productivity within and across life-stages. However, we assume that observed fish density is a poor predictor of habitat capacity owing to both a paucity of individuals (e.g., low escapement levels) and the existence of unmeasured biotic or abiotic variables that may limit capacity. To address this, we have developed a novel approach to estimate the carrying capacity of wadable streams to support spawning and rearing Chinook slamon and steelhead a quantile random forest (QRF; @Meinshausen2006; @Cade2003; @IdahoOSCTeam2019 - Appendix B) described in @See2021.


# Methods

## Focal Species

The focal species for the QRF habitat capacity assessment are:

* Spring-run Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*; hereafter Chinook salmon)
* Middle Columbia River summer steelhead (*O. mykiss*; hereafter steelhead; ESA-listed threatened)

While our habitat capacity models specifically address Chinook salmon and steelhead, any uplift in habitat for these species are expected to also uplift:

* Columbia River bull trout (*Salvelinus confluentus*; ESA-listed threatened)
* Pacific lamprey (*Lampetra tridentata*)


## Study Area

This assessment will be focused on the alluvial channel of the Walla Walla River from the confluence with Dry Creek near Lowden, Washington, to the headwaters of the North and South forks of the Walla Walla River. The primary study area includes approximately 70 miles of stream.


## General Approach

The habitat capacity assessment focuses on Chinook salmon and steelhead. Habitat capacity deficits (Figure \@ref(fig:capacity-schematic) due to potential limitations in habitat quantity and quality were assessed at three life stages for both Chinook salmon and steelhead: spawning (redd) capacity, and juvenile rearing capacity during both summer and winter months. First, life-stage-specific capacity required to support adult abundance to achieve recovery goals was estimated using a Generalized Capacity Model (Appendix C in @IdahoOSCTeam2019). Following, we estimate currently available redd and juvenile rearing capacity using a quantile random forest (QRF) approach [@See2021]. Life-stage-specific required capacities were then compared to available capacity to identify capacity deficits for Chinook salmon and steelhead.

params = read_csv(here("analysis/data/raw_data/LifeHistoryParameters.csv"))

rec_goals = tibble(Species = c("Chinook", "Steelhead"),
                   Scenario = "CBPTF 2020",
                   Escapement = c(3600, 3400)) %>%
  inner_join(params %>%
               mutate(Parameter = recode(Parameter,

                                         "Fecundity" = "fecund",
                                         "Egg:Parr" = "egg_to_parr",
                                         "Parr:Presmolt" = "parr_to_presmolt")) %>%
               pivot_wider(id_cols = "Species",
                           names_from = "Parameter",
                           values_from = "Value")) %>%
  mutate(`Female Escapement` = Escapement * prop_fem,
         Redds = `Female Escapement` * redd_per_fem,
         Eggs = Redds * fecund,
         `Summer Juveniles` = Eggs * egg_to_parr,
         `Winter Juveniles` = `Summer Juveniles` * parr_to_presmolt) %>%
  select(-c(prop_fem:parr_to_presmolt)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Escapement, `Female Escapement`:`Winter Juveniles`),
               names_to = "LifeStage",
               values_to = "Abundance")


```

Life-stage-specific capacity requirement were estimates using a Generalized Capacity Model described in Appendix C of @IdahoOSCTeam2019 which uses a combination of empirical and literature-based parameter estimates (Table \@ref(tab:param-tab)) to determine capacity necessary to achieve a given adult abundance goal. We used adult escapement goals of `r prettyNum(rec_goals$Abundance[rec_goals$Species == "Chinook" & rec_goals$LifeStage == "Escapement"], big.mark = ",")` for Chinook salmon and `r prettyNum(rec_goals$Abundance[rec_goals$Species == "Steelhead" & rec_goals$LifeStage == "Escapement"], big.mark = ",")` for steelhead. These escapement goals are "high-range" goals and are intended to represent "healthy and harvestable abundance levels that would sustain very high levels of species viability, significant fishery opportunities and harvest, and a fuller range of ecological values" [@CBPTF2020]. Briefly, these adult escapement goals are multiplied step-wise by parameter values in Table \@ref(tab:param-tab) to determine the abundance for a given life-stage necessary to support that goal. As an example, the adult escapement goal is multiplied by an estimate of the proportion of female in the population and an estimate of the redds per female to determine the number of redds necessary for recovery. Sources for each of the parameter estimates are provided in Table \@ref(tab:param-tab); however, those values can be modified if e.g., more up-to-date or local estimates are available and justifiable.

```{r param-tab}
params %>%
  kable(booktabs = T,
        digits = 3,
        format.args = list(big.mark = ",",
                           drop0trailing = T),
        caption = "Life history parameters for the generalized capacity model.") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F,
                position = "center")

```


## Available Capacity

Available capacity estimates were generated following the quantile random forest (QRF) framework described in @See2021. The QRF approach enables spatially continuous estimates of available habitat capacity given existing conditions and for key life-stages of Chinook salmon and steelhead. Currently, available QRF models allow evaluation of three anadromous life stages: 1) spawning capacity (i.e., the number of redds that can be supported), 2) summer juvenile rearing capacity (i.e., the number of parr that can be supported during low-flow summer months), and 3) winter juvenile rearing capacity (i.e., the number of presmolts that can be supported through winter months). The QRF models to estimate available habitat capacity, including data inputs, are described in detail in Appendix B of @IdahoOSCTeam2019.

We define habitat (carrying) capacity as the maximal abundance or load the habitat can support for a given species and life stage given current resources and habitat quantity and quality. The approach involves fitting a QRF model to paired fish and habitat data across hundreds of sites in seven watersheds within the Columbia River Basin. Habitat data from the Colmbia Habitat Monitoring Program (CHaMP) were paired to juvenile fish and redd survey data to develop fish-habitat relationships [@See2021]. Importantly, the QRF model places no constraints on possible fish-habitat relationships; instead, relationships are estimated from the empirical data regardless of being positive, negative, linear, non-linear, etc. Based on the observed fish-habitat relationships, we can then predict habitat capacity at any location using measurements of the same habitat covariates used to populate the model (e.g., at all CHaMP sites) (Table \@ref(tab:cov-tbl)). The random forest model produces a distribution of predictions, one for each tree in the forest, and we chose the 90th quantile of that distribution as a proxy for carrying capacity.

```{r cov-tbl}
load(here("analysis/data/derived_data/hab_cov_tbl.rda"))

hab_cov_tbl %>%
  select(-Covariate) %>%
  kable(booktabs = T,
        caption = "Habitat covariates and their descriptions used in each of the QRF capacity models. Numbers indicate where each metric ranked in relative importance for each model. Dots indicate a metric was not used for a given model.") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center")

```


### Extrapolation

Although we have hundreds of sites across the Columbia River basin with detailed habitat data, and therefore QRF predictions of capacity at those sites, that really only covers a small percentage of the anadromous zone, evein within watersheds with those sites. And many watershed, including the Walla Walla, contain no sites whatsoever.<!--I need to verify that statement, there may be a small number of CHaMP sites in the Walla Walla, but I believe, not--> Therefore, to extrapolate our capacity predictions at CHaMP sites to other areas, we used a [stream layer](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/datatech/data/col_basin_hist_project/index.cfm) available from NOAA fisheries. This layer consists of a polyline shapefile divided into 200m reaches with various attributes attached to each reach. We refer to these as globally available attributes (GAAs) because they are associated with every reach across all watersheds in the Columbia River Basin. The file is derived  from the [National Hydrography Dataset High Resolution](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution) (NHDPlus HR) dataset, which has a high resolution, 1:24,000. Here, we used GAA data available for the Upper Walla Walla River watershed to estimate capacity at the watershed scale.

We fit an extrapolation model using the predicted capacity (in either linear or areal density) as the response, and various GAAs as the covariates. The extrapolation model was also a random forest model; the nature of the random forest models allows for non-linear associations between capacity and some GAAs, while also preventing the extrapolation from growing beyond the largest predicted capacities in our initial dataset. We calculated the standard error of our predictions by the standard deviation of the random forest predicted distribution at each reach. The capacity of each 200m reach is calculated by multiplying the predicted fish/m capacity by the length of that reach. To determine the total capacity for a specified region, the capacities of each reach within that region are summed.

<!--Finally, we leverage a NorWeST summer stream temperature model [@Isaak2012; @Peterson2013; @Isaak2017] to evaluate changes in predicted capacity for target species and life-stages given various changing climate scenarios.-->


## Capacity Limitations

Finally, habitat capacity deficits (limitations) can then be estimated as the required capacity minus the available capacity. We estimated capacity deficits, including relative deficits, for the Upper Walla Walla watershed to identify potential species and life-stage limitations in physical habitat quantity and/or quality.


# Results

## Required Capacity

The resulting estimates of habitat capacity requirements are shown in Table \@ref(tab:require-tab), based on recovery goals defined in @CBPTF2020. These abundance estimates represent the required number of a given life-stage that are necessary to achieve target adult escapement goals.
